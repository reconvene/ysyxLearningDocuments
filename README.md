# YSYX Learning Documents

This repository contains my study notes and documentation for the YSYX learning journey.

Currently, it includes:
- Markdown notes covering key concepts
- Learning materials and examples related to RISC-V and SoC design

The goal is to document and consolidate my progress as I learn CPU architecture and digital design through the YSYX project.
